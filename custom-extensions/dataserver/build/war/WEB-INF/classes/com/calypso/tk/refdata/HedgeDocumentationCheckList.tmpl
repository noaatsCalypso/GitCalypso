                  DOES THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP MEET ALL OF THE CRITERIA BELOW?
@2
      The notional amount on the swap matches the principal amount (or portion of principal amount) 
      of the interest-bearing asset or liability being hedged (example bond, loan or note).
@4
      The fair value or the swap at inception was zero (no upfront fee payments were made or received).
      If the hedging instrument is a compound derivative composed of an interest rate swap and
      mirror-image call or put option, then the premium for the call or put option must be paid or received
      in the same manner as the premium on the call or put option embedded in the hedged item.
@3
      The formula for computing net settlements is the same for each net settlement (that is, 
      the fixed rate is the same throughout the term and the variable rate is based 
      on the same index and includes the same constant adjustment).
@2
      The underlying debt is not prepayable (or if so, at or above fair value), except 
      if the debt and the interest rate swap contain mirror prepayment options.
@2
      The index on which the variable leg of the swap is based matches the benchmark interest rate 
      being hedged for that hedging relationship.
@2
      Any other terms in the interest-bearing financial instruments or interest rate swaps are typical 
      of those instruments and do not invalidate the assumption of ineffectiveness.
