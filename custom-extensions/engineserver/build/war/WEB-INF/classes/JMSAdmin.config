#  The following line specifies which JNDI service provider is in use.
#  It currently indicates an LDAP service provider. If a different
#  service provider is used, this line should be commented out and the
#  appropriate one should be uncommented.

#INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY=com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory
INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY=com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory
#INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY=com.ibm.ejs.ns.jndi.CNInitialContextFactory

#  If you don't have SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION=none, then JMSAdmin will
#  prompt you for the User DN and password.  If you want to bypass these
#  prompts then you can specify one or both of the values here.  Since
#  the password here is in cleartext this is not normally recommended
#  except for testing.  You should replace these values with your own.

#PROVIDER_USERDN=cn=Manager,o=ibm,c=uk
#PROVIDER_PASSWORD=secret

# will be overrided by including the flags.
