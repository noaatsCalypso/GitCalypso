<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The purpose of this communication (this &quot;<B>Confirmation</B>&quot;) is to set forth the terms and conditions of the Credit Derivative Transaction entered into on the Trade Date specified below (the &quot;<B>Transaction</B>&quot;) between |SENDER_FULL_NAME| (&quot;<B>Market Dealer</B>&quot;) and |RECEIVER_FULL_NAME| (&quot;<B>Counterparty</B>&quot;).  This Confirmation constitutes a &quot;<B>Confirmation</B>&quot; as referred to in the ISDA Master Agreement specified below.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The definitions and provisions contained in the 2003 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions as supplemented by the May 2003 Supplement to the 2003 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions, each as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (together, the &quot;<B>Credit Derivatives Definitions</B>&quot;), are incorporated into this Confirmation.  In the event of any inconsistency between the Credit Derivatives Definitions and this Confirmation, this Confirmation will govern.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This Confirmation supplements, forms a part of and is subject to the ISDA Master Agreement dated as of |TRADE_DATE|, as amended and supplemented from time to time (the &quot;<B>Agreement</B>&quot;) between Market Dealer and Counterparty.  All provisions contained in, or incorporated by reference in, the Agreement shall govern this Confirmation except as expressly modified below.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This Confirmation relates to a basket of Reference Entities (as described below).  Each settlement in respect of a Reference Entity following a Credit Event will terminate only the corresponding portion of this Transaction, as outlined below.  Without prejudice to Section 3.9 of the Credit Derivatives Definitions, upon the occurrence of an Event Determination Date with respect to a Reference Entity, additional Credit Events with respect to that Reference Entity will not have any effect on this Transaction (a) unless that Reference Entity subsequently becomes a Successor to another Reference Entity in respect of which an Event Determination Date has not occurred and (b) except as otherwise provided in the &quot;Successors&quot; provision below.  This Transaction contemplates that there may be more than one Credit Event and accordingly more than one Event Determination Date and more than one settlement and that the Credit Derivatives Definitions (and in particular the definition of Termination Date) should, for the purposes of this Transaction, be interpreted accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The terms of the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates are as follows:</span></p>
