This Confirmation evidences a complete and binding agreement between you
and us as to the terms of the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates.  In addition, you and
we agree to use all reasonable efforts promptly to negotiate, execute and deliver an agreement in the
form of the ISDA Master Agreement (the &quot;ISDA Form&quot;), with such
modifications as you and we will in good faith agree.  Upon the execution by you and us of such an agreement,
this Confirmation will supplement, form a part of and be subject to that agreement.  All provisions contained
in or incorporated by reference in that agreement upon its execution will govern this Confirmation except as
expressly modified below.  Until we execute and deliver that agreement, this Confirmation, together with all
other documents referring to the ISDA Master Agreement (each a &quot;Confirmation&quot;) confirming transactions (each a
&quot;Transaction&quot;) entered into between us (notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a Confirmation),
shall supplement, form a part of, and be subject to, an agreement in the form of the ISDA Form as if we had
executed an agreement in such form (but without any Schedule except for the election of

Date of the first such Transaction between us.  In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of
that agreement and this Confirmation, this Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of this Transaction.
