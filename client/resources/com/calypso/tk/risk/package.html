Risk analysis and reporting classes. Just as all single-instrument 
valuation is done using the Pricer.price() method 
in the Calypso system, all multiple-instrument valuation is 
done using the Analysis.run() method. An application that 
calculates a valuation or risk analysis will always call the 
run() method, regardless of the type of analysis it wishes to 
perform. Each subclass of Analysis represents a type of analysis.
  <p>There are six main classes involved in setting up, running, and 
displaying a single analysis. These classes are
<br>
<ol><li> a subclass of Analysis, to compute the analysis
<li> a parameters entry window class that implements the 
 interface AnalysisParamViewer. This lets the user create 
 parameters object which is...
<li> a subclass of AnalysisParameters. This object conveys the 
 user's preferences concerning how the analysis should be run.
<li> a subclass of AnalysisOutput, to contain the results of the 
 analysis
<li> the AnalysisViewerConfig class, to specify which viewer 
 class will display the results. You will use AnalysisUtil to 
 make use of the AnalysisViewerConfig.
<li> an analysis results window class that implements the 
 interface AnalysisViewer. This displays the results.
</ol>

<p>To add your own analysis, create a subclass of Analysis (for 
example 'XAnalysis') that implements the run() method, and 
create an AnalysisOutput class (for example 'XOutput') that 
will format the results of your analysis class.
  <p>To display your results, Calypso provides a standard viewer, 
DefaultAnalysisViewer, which can display any report that is a 
spreadsheet-style table of values. If you wish to create a 
different type of display, then you can create a class 
('XAnalysisViewer', for example) that implements the 
AnalysisViewer interface. Whatever viewer you choose, you must 
register it in the Analysis Viewer Config window in the main 
Calypso application.
  <p>If your analysis requires parameters that are not in 
Calypso's AnalysisParamStd object, create a subclass of 
AnalysisParameters (XAnalysisParameters, for example). If you 
wish to allow the user to edit these parameters, create a GUI 
window class that implements the AnalysisParamViewer 
interface ('XAnalysisParamViewer', for example).
